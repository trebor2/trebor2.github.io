Hey there.

I’m Robert. I'm a college freshman and 20. This website is from when I applied to college as a senior in high school. While this project is still active, the website doesn't reflect this. I've left it as is because it's still a good introduction to the project without jeopardizing new research. If curious for where I've been in the interim, here is a copy of my <a href="/assets/RBM%20modern%20resume%20winter%202018.pdf">resume</a>. This is the only modified text on the website. Everything else is mint to Winter 2016/2017.

If you've made it this far, I'd like to thank you for visiting, and hope you enjoyed the site. 

If you’d like to talk to me about this project, some other projects, or what’s on my opportunity radar, contact me.

Other Projects of Mine:

- Public Art; or, how to be the worlds greatest art thief, February 2016 - Present
- Control theory for brushless motors, October 2013 - May 2015
- More to come soon

Common Questions:

<i>Have you considered a science fair?</i>

> I have participated in fairs to an extremely limited extent - my priority is protecting IP, so what I did share was always a very small subset of actual research. I have won the following awards from my presentation "Improvements on construction of ergonomically  friendly actuators and joints":
- Connecticut Junior Sciences & Humanities Symposium People’s Choice Award, 2017
- Connecticut Science & Engineering Fair Barnes Aerospace Applied Technology Award, 2017
- Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation Excellence in Science and Mathematics Award, 2016
- Greens Farms Academy Roger B True Science Research Award, 2016
In general, this isn’t a ‘science’ project. It’s a feasibility study first, design challenge second, sociology project third. I never brought any of my most recent research to fair. 

<i>Can you share CAD files, the source code for the video demonstration, or other mentions of custom software?</i>

> Not currently. I’m fine sharing renders and some details, but this website is really the tip of the ice-berg in terms of the work I’ve done, and research produced. What you see is everything I decided wouldn’t endanger future IP. If I could provide source code, I would. 

<i>How do you calculate pricing for prototypes?</i>

> In the case of 3D printed components, the estimates are material cost, so the estimate is very accurate. For machined components, I use <a href="https://www.protolabs.com/" target="_blank">protolabs</a> or similar prototyping facilities. For more complex components, like custom motor stators or gel pads, I contact actual manufacturers, so somewhat accurate. Other components, like electronics or bearings, I use companies like digi-key or McMaster-Carr. This method does ignore the time cost on my behalf, but I've never been in this for the money, so my time is free.
